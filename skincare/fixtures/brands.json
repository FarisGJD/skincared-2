            "about": "When skin is exposed to irritants and sensitizers, damage can be imperceptible and cumulative, leaving it in a reactive mode. We believe we have 'sensitive' skin, but it's often really just skin that has become sensitized over time, which is a problem that can be easily addressed. When I created Drunk Elephant, I isolated the most effective ingredients—both synthetic and natural—that directly benefit the health of the skin. I formulated the products using a high percentage of active ingredients at skin-friendly pH levels, and I made sure that all of the ingredients were recognized by the skin and easily absorbed. A routine is only as good as its worst product, and a product only as good as its worst ingredient. In other words, it takes just one bad guy to ruin the party.",

Eight years later, he sold the business to fellow pharmacist Oscar Troplowitz who began to manufacture products under the Beiersdorf brand name. Close cooperation with pioneering dermatologist Paul Gerson Unna meant that these products were inspired by and based on the very latest research of skin. This combination of research and development runs through our history, right up to the present day. It means that every one of our products is both scientifically relevant and proven for tolerability and efficacy, providing you with reliable solutions for different kinds of skin issues and problems.",

'We felt we could deliver products that were ten times better by putting real skin-care ingredients into them.' They formulated their lotion with hyaluronic acid, peptides, and antioxidants, and filled their Body Wash with niacinamide and a slew of essential oils, getting it to foam with plant-derived surfactants.",
